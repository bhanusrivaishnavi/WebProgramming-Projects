Fifteen Puzzle

The Fifteen Puzzle, also known as the Sliding Puzzle, is a classic logic-based game consisting of a 4x4 grid containing 15 numbered tiles and one empty space. 
Players aim to rearrange the tiles into numerical order (1 to 15, left-to-right, top-to-bottom) by sliding a tile adjacent to the empty space. 
This game encourages problem-solving and spatial reasoning. The project will create an interactive web-based version of the Fifteen Puzzle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game will feature responsive design, smooth animations, and additional functionality to enhance the user experience.
